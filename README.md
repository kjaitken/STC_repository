#This is the minimal data and code for the STC project on bladder regeneration. It is a work in progress. 
#The minimal data for the plots are loaded in the github datasets (https://github.com/kjaitken/STC_repository/tree/main/github%20datasets) folder. 

#The code for plotting is available in the STC markdown pdf or html files, or as the R markdown (STC_minimal_data_and_markdown.Rmd). 

Detailed statistical analysis methods will be loaded later in future folders, but the minimal data in the csv's is sufficient to analyse the data. In brief, analysis of variance was performed using a linear model, and attention was paid to the normalcy or distribution of the data. Subsequent t.tests were performed as required, as either a Student's, kruskal's or welch's depending on the normalcy and distribution.
